I took on this engaging Power BI project to help me learn how to transform and model data using power query, visualize data, and build reports using charts, graphs, and interactive dashboards, to effectively communicate data insights. 

------

This project focuses on data professionals with the aim of analyzing results from a survey taken by individuals in different career paths. This project shows my skills in analyzing and visualizing data, and deriving isights from given data set.

_Disclaimer: The dataset used in this project is a dummy dataset used to practice and demonstrate skills in Power Bi. They do not represent any company or organisation._

## Problem Statement

This project aims to discover:
* Data careers with the average highest salary
* Professionals' satisfaction with salary and work/life balance
* Favorite programming language

## Data Sourcing

I downloaded the data from the web as an excel file.

## Data Transformation

Using power query on Power Bi, I inspected the dataset and found it free of errors. However, I took an avergae of the salary range, using this average for my visualization. Additionally, I made use of delimiters in removing extra options from the **favorite programming language** and **industry** columns.

## Analysis & Visualization

1. There were 630 participants on this survey across different countries with an average age of 29 years. Interestingly, only 26% of the participants are females.
2. The top identified job roles are Data Analysts, Data Engineers, Data Scientists, Data Developers, and Students. Of these roles, Data Analysts have the highest average salary, compared to Data Developers and Architects.
3. This analysis shows that most professionals prefer using python as a programming language. The least preferred languages are JavaScript and Java. Among _others_ the highest preferred was SQL.
4. On an average, only half the surveyed population are satisfied with their salary and work/life balance.
5. 21% of the praticipants report that it was easy to break into their roles, while 26% report that it was difficult. However, 43% say it was neither difficult nor easy.

## Conclusion
As my first project, this project has not only helped me learn the power basics but has also introduced me to documentation on GitHub. I look forward to working with more datasets, documenting and sharing my learning journey with you.
